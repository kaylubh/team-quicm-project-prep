## Conflict Plan

### What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

Even if there is no conflict, having daily check-ins to get feedback on how everything went. If there is conflict, talking about it as a group, or scheduling time to check in with a person if there is a specific conflict.

### What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

Ensuring no one member takes over the majority of a section, by checking in with the team. Giving  everyone a chance to practice, even with things that they may not be as comfortable with. Allocating tasks and sticking to ownership of said tasks, to mitigate potential “overworking.” Communicating when a task is too much for one singular person.

### How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

Being respectful of one another and not patronizing if a person does not understand as well. Ensuring inclusion of all team members regardless of understanding/skill level. Patience.

### How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

Checking in first to see if they need help, and if that doesn’t help, escalating to a group discussion of how we can better support if need be.

### How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

Reaching out to JB/Tammy, if necessary, with concerns that cannot be resolved internally.
